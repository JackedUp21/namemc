# Name MC
The unofficial Node JS package for looking up Minecraft users on [Name MC](https://namemc.com/)

*âš  This package is not affiliated with Name MC or Minecraft in any way*

## Searching by username
```javascript
import { lookupName } from "namemc"; // require works aswell

const name = "tehpicix";

// Search users
const users = await lookupName(name);

// Results are ordered as they are on Name MC so users[0] may not be the most revelant result,
// you can filter the response as seen below to find the most revelant result, this gives you the 
const user = users.filter(({ currentName }) => currentName.toLowerCase() === name.toLowerCase())[0];

```

## Searching by UUID
```javascript
import { lookupUUID } from "namemc"; // require works aswell

// Lookup user
const user = await lookupUUID("1eb084b8-588e-43e6-bdd3-e05e53682987");
```

## Caveats
1. This package is powered by [Web Scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping), meaning that if Name MC were to suddenly change the HTML layout on their page it would cause the package to break until I were update it.
2. Name MC will rate-limit you after a certian amount of requests. In my opinion, they're very generous about this, after spamming an obscene amount of requests, the most I got limited for was 5 seconds. The package will reject the promise if you are being rate limited.

## API
If you need to use this in a browser and arent using a bundler, you can send API requests to my server to resolve names.
Endpoints and their info can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/JoshMerlino/namemc/wiki).
